# Evaluation Report

**Date:** 2025-07-04
**Agent:** evaluation_agent

## 1. Overview
I have reviewed the outputs and code produced by the modeling_agent against the business requirements and agreed definitions for:

1. Utilization trends
2. Peak demand periods
3. Capacity pressure
4. Reliability/downtime

This report summarizes my findings, confirms adherence to requirements, raises questions, and provides suggestions for refinement.

## 2. Review of Metrics and Code Implementation

### 2.1 Utilization Trends
- **Output:** `/root/output/outputs/daily_utilization_trends.csv`
- **Method:** Computed daily average occupancy rate per station as mean of hourly occupancy rates where occupancy_rate = charging_count / total_messages (excluding UNKNOWN records).
- **Validation:** Code in `compute_utilization_trends` correctly groups by station and date. Timestamps are converted to UTC and floored to hours.

### 2.2 Peak Demand Periods
- **Output:** `/root/output/outputs/peak_periods_station.csv`
- **Method:** For each station, selected top 5 hours by occupancy_rate (hourly granularity).
- **Validation:** `compute_peak_periods` accurately sorts and selects top_n hours per station.

### 2.3 Global Peak Hour-of-Day
- **Output:** `/root/output/outputs/global_peak_hour_of_day.csv`
- **Method:** Aggregated average occupancy_rate by hour of day across all stations.
- **Validation:** `compute_global_peak_by_hour_of_day` is correct; peaks around 10:00–11:00.

### 2.4 Capacity Pressure
- **Output:** `/root/output/outputs/capacity_pressure_station.csv`
- **Method:** For each station, counted hours where occupancy_rate ≥ 0.9, then computed ratio to total hours.
- **Validation:** `compute_capacity_pressure` correctly implements threshold logic.

### 2.5 Reliability / Downtime
- **Output:** `/root/output/outputs/reliability_evse_downtime.csv`
- **Method:** For each EVSE, identified contiguous runs of hours with charging_count == 0 of length ≥ 24 hours and counted events and total downtime hours.
- **Validation:** `compute_reliability_downtime` correctly detects runs using run-length encoding logic.

## 3. Observations and Questions
1. **Treatment of 'UNKNOWN' Status:**
   - In data_prep, we excluded UNKNOWN records (~10.7%) from all metrics. This decision reduces ambiguity but may bias occupancy rates if UNKNOWN corresponds to either available or unavailable states.
   - **Question for business:** Should UNKNOWN be treated as unavailable (i.e., count in denominator), or is exclusion acceptable?

2. **Occupancy Denominator:**
   - Currently, denominator = total messages after excluding UNKNOWN, including statuses `AVAILABLE`, `OUTOFORDER`, `BLOCKED`, etc. For pure utilization, perhaps denominator should only be hours when station is operational (exclude OUTOFORDER)?
   - **Suggestion:** Consider refining occupancy_rate = charging_count / (charging_count + available_count), isolating operational availability.

3. **Capacity Pressure Definition:**
   - We use station-level occupancy_rate as proxy for EVSE count utilization. If station has many EVSEs, message counts may not reflect actual EVSE occupancy proportionally.
   - **Suggestion:** Derive occupancy per EVSE (binary occupied/unoccupied per hour) and compute station pressure as fraction of EVSEs occupied.

4. **Reliability Metric Scope:**
   - Downtime defined as no charging for ≥24 hrs, independent of status. This may treat low-use rural EVSEs as downtime events.
   - **Suggestion:** Differentiate between `OUTOFORDER` status-based downtime vs genuine idle periods.

5. **Time Series Completeness:**
   - Ensure hourly occupancy time series includes all hours in study period for each station/EVSE, filling missing hours with zero counts to accurately detect downtime.

## 4. Suggestions for Next Steps
- Clarify handling of UNKNOWN and non-operational statuses with business agent.
- Adjust occupancy_rate denominator to exclude non-serviceable hours.
- Consider EVSE-level occupancy flags for capacity pressure.
- Augment reliability analysis to account for status-based downtime.
- Validate that data pipeline fills gaps for missing hours.
