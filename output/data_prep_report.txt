# Data Preparation Report

## 1. Objectives
- Clean and transform raw NOBIL Avro snapshot data into a usable format for modeling.
- Analyze missing values, specifically the handling of the 'UNKNOWN' status.
- Build an hourly occupancy time series per station and per EVSE.

## 2. Data Cleaning & Missing Value Analysis
- Processed a development sample of 50 Avro files (114,660 records).
- Parsed key fields: `nobilId` (station_id), `evseUId` (evse_id), `status`, and `timestamp`.
- Dropped records with null station, evse, status, or timestamp.
- Converted `timestamp` to UTC datetime.
- Status distribution (sample):
  - UNKNOWN: 12,239 / 114,660 (10.67%)
- Decision: Excluded `UNKNOWN` status from occupancy metrics due to ambiguity regarding availability.

## 3. Occupancy Time Series Construction
- For remaining records, floored timestamps to hourly windows.
- Aggregated counts by `station_id`, `hour`, and `status`.
- Computed per-hour occupancy rate: `charging` count / `total` messages.
- Repeated aggregation at EVSE (charging point) level.
- Output files:
  - `/root/output/data/status_summary.csv`: overall status counts.
  - `/root/output/data/occupancy_station_hourly.parquet`
  - `/root/output/data/occupancy_evse_hourly.parquet`
  - `/root/output/data/flattened_sample.parquet`: cleaned raw records.
  - `/root/output/data/unknown_analysis.txt`: missing value analysis details.

## 4. Scalability & Next Steps
- The Python script in `/root/output/code/data_prep/data_prep.py` can process larger data by adjusting `--sample_size` or removing sampling.
- For full ingestion, run without sampling or in parallel via chunked Avro readers.
- Next: hand-off to modeling_agent to compute utilization trends, peak demand, capacity pressure, and reliability metrics using these time series.

## 5. Code Availability
- Data preparation script: `/root/output/code/data_prep/data_prep.py`
